<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project aims to create a sophisticated gym progress and habit tracking app. Users can plan workouts, form habits, and share personalized plans easily due to the exercise recommendation system. They can also monitor real-time instructions through "live training mode," adjust exercise intensity based on past achievements, and view their gym statistics. The app, designed for iOS and Android, will also use notifications to keep users motivated. Technologically, it'll rely on React Native, Node.js with Express, and a PostgreSQL database.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

#### May

- Application, server and database configuration
- Preparation of application designs in Figma
- Ability to register and log into the system
- Adding new exercises
- Listing of available exercises
- Basic creation of training plans from exercises available in the application, ability to search for exercises by name + pagination
- User profile, ability to log out of the application and view user information
- Basic settings of the application, changing the application theme, language (Polish, English)

#### June

- Calendar, training planning - the ability to view the calendar and scheduled events for specific days. When you press a particular day, under the calendar you can see information about the training that has been planned for that day
- Live training mode - the ability to select the workout you created and turn it on in live mode. In each step you should see:
  the name and description of the current exercise,
  buttons for changing the exercise (next and previous)
- A button to edit the planned load or number of repetitions
  After completing the entire workout, a summary with basic workout information should be shown.
- Basic statistics - the ability to view the current state of progress in the form of summarized graphs. Ability to add measurements and analyze them. Initial progress prediction functionality.
- Notifications - these will be notifications regarding upcoming workouts, reminding you to exercise.
- Onboarding flow, taking weight, height and body part measurements.
- Basic exercise recommendation system for training plan. At this stage, it will suggest exercises based on selected muscle parts
